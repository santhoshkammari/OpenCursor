# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

## Definition
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized framework that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to connect with external data sources, tools, and systems. It addresses the challenge of integrating LLMs with real-time or specialized data beyond their training knowledge.

## Key Features
- **Interoperability**: Allows LLMs to interface with databases, APIs, and external tools.
- **Dynamic Context**: Enables models to access up-to-date information during inference.
- **Modularity**: Supports plug-and-play integration with various systems.

## How It Works
MCP provides a structured communication layer where LLMs can:
1. Request data from external sources
2. Execute operations via APIs
3. Receive real-time responses to enhance answers

## Benefits
- Improves accuracy with current data
- Extends model capabilities beyond training data
- Facilitates complex task automation
